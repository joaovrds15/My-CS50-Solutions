                <p>
                    Hello, I am João Victor, and this site is part of the CS50 course problem sets.
                    Well, I grew up in a small city in Brazil, and since I was a child, I used to have this passion for video games, my desire to be involved with computers started when I got my first one.
                    I did not know that computers must have a minimum requirement to play games, so I had to figure out which processor my laptop had and which games it could run.
                    Then I got curious about what gigahertz was and processors core.
                    Therefore I thought I wanted to become a game developer, a dream most children who play games had.
                    As I grew up, my interest in games decreased a lot, and eventually, my game dev dream, but I still wanted to be involved with computers.
                    Thus I decided to major in technology, and now I am on a journey to become a back-end developer.<br>
